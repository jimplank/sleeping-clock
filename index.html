Thorpaw's Binary Sleeping Clock is a clock with six lights.  Four of them keep track of the
hour, and the remaining two keep track of the 15-minute interval within the hour.  Therefore,
by looking at it, you know roughly what time it is, but with a minimum of information being
transmitted to you.

<p>
I have two clocks pictured below.
The one on the left is with a generic circuit board - I have made a variety of
these with a variety of circuit boards.  On the right, I experimented and designed
my own circuit board for the clock, so it's more likely that if you're reading this,
you have the one on the right.

<td><a href=clock.jpg><img src=pcb-clock.jpg width=400></a></td>
</table></center><p>

Regardless of the circuit board, each clock features:

<UL>
<LI> A bank of four lights, colored blue, red, yellow and white.
<LI> A set of two lights, usually smaller, which are green and blue.
<LI> Two buttons -- one on the left and one on the right.
</UL>

<h3>Reading the hours</h3>

The four lights are binary digits for the hours.  You read them as numbers from 1 to 12.
Here's how the lights correspond to hours:

<p><center><table border=3><td><a href=hours.jpg><img src=hours.jpg width=300></a></td></table></center><p>

In other words:

<UL>
<LI> White is the one's digit (zero when off, one when on).
<LI> Yellow is the two's digit (zero when off, two when on).
<LI> Red is the four's digit (zero when off, four when on).
<LI> Blue is the eight's digit (zero when off, eight when on).
</UL>

So, for example, when the red and white lights are on, you add four (red) plus one (white)
to get five.

<h3>Reading the quarter-hours</h3>

The green and blue lights show the quarter hour:

<p><center><table border=3><td><a href=quarters.jpg><img src=quarters.jpg width=250></a></td></table></center><p>

<hr>
<h3>Practice</h3>

Here are four light-settings for practice.  I can tell you the important one for me is seeing
the blue light in the morning, which tells me that it's 8:00, and I typically have about an 
hour before I have to get up:

<p><center><table border=3><td><a href=practice.jpg><img src=practice.jpg width=250></a></td></table></center><p>

<hr>
<h3>Setting the Clock / The Buttons</h3>

Here are the functions of the buttons:

<UL>
<LI> <b>Left button, quick press:</b> Changes the hour.
<LI> <b>Left button, hold down:</b> Changes the quarter-hour.
<LI> <b>Right button, quick press:</b> Dims the lights (eight settings, and then it resets).
<LI> <b>Right button, hold down:</b> Changes the minutes after the quarter hour.  This may
     confuse you, so keep reading.
</UL>

When you're setting the clock, do the following three steps:

<OL>
<LI> Set the hour, using quick pressed of the left button.
<LI> Once you have set the hour, set the quarter hour by holding down the left button.
<LI> Now set the minutes after the quarter hour, by holding down the right button.  The
     bank of four lights will cycle through the numbers from one to fourteen.  Release
     the button at the correct time.
</OL>

Why do you need to set the minutes after the quarter-hour when you can't see them on the
clock?  The answer is that the clock needs to know when to change the quarter-hour and the hour.
<p>
You might need to think a little here if the quarter hour is blue (15-30) or blue+green (45-60).
You add the minutes to the quarter hour, so, for example
it's 18 minutes after the hour, then you need to set the quarter hour to blue, and then
hold down the right button until the yellow and white lights are on: 15+3 = 18.
</UL>

<h3>Dimming the lights</h3>

The clock is pretty bright at night, so you'll likely want to dim it.  Do that with quick presses
of the right button.  There are 8 levels of dimness, and after you get to the last, it will cycle
back to the first.

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

(These are notes for me, but if you're interested, please read).
<p>
The clock is driven by an Arduino microcontroller.  I'm partial to the one by "Elegoo", which is $14
as of when I'm writing this (<a href=https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Compliant/dp/B01EWOE0UU>https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Compliant/dp/B01EWOE0UU</a>), however I'm tinkering with a cheaper Nano (<a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0713XK923>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0713XK923</a>), which is under $6.
The Arduino, conveniently, has six "PWM" outputs, where you can set the output value.
I use these to control the dimming of the LED's.  Without them, I'd have to hardwire the
brightness using resistors.
<p>
For my first clocks, I have 
soldered the LED's and resistors onto a generic "shield".  This is a circuit board that is
designed to stack on top of the Arduino, and has holes for you to solder in your circuits.
My first set used sing shields from
"ElectroCookie" (<a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MTFY2PR>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MTFY2PR</a>).
I wasn't happy with these because there are three different
shields, and I'd rather just have the blue shield, which has multiple holes pre-wired and nice
strips of ground holes.  The green shield is in the picture above, and is a pain because it
only has three ground holes, and I need eight.
I picked up blue shields from Ebay (<a href=https://www.ebay.com/itm/172443976013>https://www.ebay.com/itm/172443976013</a>), but that listing might go away.  You can search "For Arduino UNO R3 Shield Board Prototype PCB DIY Combo 2mm+2.54mm Pitch" -- seller "modulefans", from China).
<p>
By the time those blue shield arrived from China, I decided to explore making my own circuit
board for the clock.  I used <tt>easyeda.com</tt> and it only took me one failed fabrication
pass to get it right.  They are nice and cheap -- $4 for 10 (of course, shipping from China is
something like $8 for two weeks.  That's still $1.20 per board).
<p>
I use 10K-ohm resistors, and could probably use higher.  When the lights are off in our
bedroom, the LED's are pretty bright, and the dimming feature helps greatly.
<p>
When using the generic shields, I'm partial to zero ohm resistors instead of wires.
They make the board look cleaner
(in the picture above, all of those resistors on the bottom are zero ohm, and I wish I
had simply used them for all of the wiring, but I was feeling cheap.  I think the
fan-out at the bottom would look much cooler had I used zero ohm resistors for all of 
the wires. 
<p>
You need to put some tape (I use duct tape) over the Elegoo's LED's.
Otherwise, they are really bright and interfere with the lights of the clock.
I haven't explored whether you need the tape with custom boards.  With the shields,
there are so many holes that you have to use the tape.
<p>
Someday when I'm bored, I'll make one of these with Neopixels.  6 neopixels = $3, and
I don't need the PWM ports.
